-- ArcUI_Tour: guided "what's new" walkthrough of the options panel.
--
-- The changelog says WHAT changed; this shows WHERE. A tour is pure data (see
-- TOURS below): a list of steps, each naming an options tab and a control label
-- to point at, plus the text to show beside it.
--
-- HOW A STEP FINDS ITS CONTROL: AceConfig builds its widgets on the fly, so
-- there is no stable handle for "the Ping Key keybinding". We open the panel,
-- SelectGroup to the step's tab, then walk the dialog's frame tree for a
-- FontString whose text matches the step's `find` label and anchor to its owner.
--
-- That is inherently fragile -- renaming an option silently orphans its step --
-- so it FAILS SOFT by design: an unfound label still shows its callout, centred
-- on the panel, with the text intact. A tour that is slightly less precise beats
-- one that errors or dead-ends.
--
-- DEV-ONLY CODE sits inside packager debug fences. The BigWigs packager strips
-- them from a release build, so /arctour dev, dump and clear do not exist in the
-- shipped addon at all: not hidden, absent.
--
-- Two rules when touching them. Anything inside a fence must leave valid Lua
-- when it is deleted. And NEVER write the fence tokens in prose, not even in a
-- comment like this one: the packager matches them anywhere, so an explanatory
-- mention opens a fence of its own and takes out everything down to the next
-- close. That exact mistake cost a 399-line strip here.
--
-- Zero IDLE cpu. The one OnUpdate here drives the ~0.35s spotlight glide and
-- clears its own script on the final frame, so nothing runs between steps or
-- while the tour is closed. The ring's breathing is an AnimationGroup. No pcall.
